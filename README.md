## Overview
The **Student** class represents a domain entity within our DDD structure. Weâ€™ll use:
- **Builder Pattern** to create `Student` objects in a readable, step-by-step manner.
- **Factory Pattern** to centralize and simplify object creation logic.

By using these patterns, we keep our code maintainable, testable, and easy to extend.
